Using ChatGPT, I reconstructed my Assignment 2 solution to be more object-oriented for Assignment 3. The two solutions are vastly different in design but still function the same. Assignment 2 has only one class that handles all the tasks whereas Assignment 3 has 5 classes. In Assignment 2, the code works directly with raw strings and transformations are applied inline to the arrays. This makes the code harder to expand and maintain as adding a new feature such as JSON input or different transformations later would mean rewriting large portions of the program. Assignment 3 separates the code into multiple classes which makes the program easier to extend and modify in the future.

Based on object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, the classes in Assignment 3 allow for clearer responsibilities with each having a specific purpose. The Product class is the domain model which holds the fields for each product. The Extractor class handles the input and creates the objects for the Product class. The Transformer class uses the rules and transformations to change the data into the desired output. The Loader class writes all the changed data to a new CSV file. Lastly, the ETLPipeline class is the main class which coordinates the flow of the program. With this format, new rules and formats can be added without touching the other classes which was not possible in the Assignment 2 solution.

Objects, classes and encapsulation were used in the updated solution. Each product instance is an object. There are several different classes that each serve a specific function. The fields in the Product class are private with public getters and setters which hide the internal data from other classes and demonstrate encapsulation. The object-oriented ideas, polymorphism and inheritance, were not used in the program as there is only one type of extractor and loader, so they were not necessary. However, this program allows for them to be added in the future if necessary. If the program needed to handle multiple data sources, an abstract DataExtractor class could be made and subclasses like CSVExtractor, JSONExtractor, or DatabaseExtractor could inherit from it. Polymorphism would enable the pipeline to work with any extractor implementation without altering the rest of the code. Even though they are not implemented here, I now better understand how they could be added.

Assignment 3 was tested with the same scenarios as assignment 2 and the output of the two were compared. Running the program as normal created an output file with all rows transformed correctly. The products.csv file was edited to have only headers, and the output file was created to have only headers with the header “PriceRange” added. With rows that have more or less than the necessary number of headers, the row is skipped, a warning is printed with the malformed line, and the line is counted in the run summary at the end. If the products.csv file is missing or deleted, the program prints an error and exits. These tests confirmed that the Assignment 3 solution still meets the same requirements as Assignment 2 while providing a more maintainable design.

Using the new implementation allows the user to see what the program does more clearly, and it is easier for modifying later if needed. Assignment 3 is more object-oriented because it separates the code into specific functions, uses encapsulation, and creates a structure where inheritance and polymorphism could be added naturally if future requirements needed them. It was a little difficult to make the program more object-oriented as I am still learning the aspects of object-oriented programs in Java. It felt a bit redundant to include so many classes at first but once I saw how each class had a purpose, the design felt cleaner. I also had to make sure that the transformations occurred in the correct order. This was a great learning experience which helped me to improve my coding skills. This assignment taught me both the benefits and challenges of applying more object-oriented ideas to a Java program and I am now more confident in using this in future projects.

Using ChatGPT, I reconstructed my assignment 2 solution to be more object-oriented for assignment 3. The two solutions are vastly different but still function the same. Assignment 2 has 1 class whereas assignment 3 has 5 classes. In assignment 2, the code works directly with raw strings and transformations were moderating the arrays inline. This makes the code harder to extend as adding JSON input later would mean rewriting huge chunks of code. Based on object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, the classes in assignment 3 allow for clearer responsibilities with each having a specific purpose. The product class is the domain model which holds the fields for each product. Extractor class handles the input and creates the objects for the product class. The transformer class uses the rules and transformations to change the data to the desired output. Loader class writes all the changed data to a new csv file. ETLPipeline is the main class which coordinates the flow of the program. With this format, new rules and formats can be added without touching the other classes.

Objects, classes and encapsulation were used in the updated solution. Each product instance is an object; there are several different classes all used for a specific function and the fields in the product class are private with public getters and setters that hide the data from other classes. The object oriented ideas, polymorphism and inheritance, were not used in the program as there is only one type of extractor and loader so they were not necessary.

Assignment 3 was tested with the same scenarios as assignment 2. Running the program as normal created an output file with all rows with transformations applied. The products.csv file was edited to have only headers, and the output file was created to have only headers with the header “PriceRange” added. With rows that have more or less than the necessary number of headers, the row is skipped, a warning is printed with the malformed line, and the line is counted in the run summary at the end. If the products.csv file is missing or deleted, the program prints an error and exits.

Using the new implementation allows the user to see what the program does more clearly. It is easier for modifying later if needed. It was a little difficult to make the program more object-oriented as I am still learning the aspects of object-oriented programs in Java. However, this was a great learning experience and definitely helped me to improve my coding skills.

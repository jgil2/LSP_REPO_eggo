Prompt: what's wrong with this code?
Response: Good catch — there are multiple issues in your DoorLock class that prevent it from compiling.
Let’s go through them one by one 👇

❌ 1. You declared main() incorrectly
private static void main(String[] args) {
    private int batteryPercent;
}

🔹 Problems:

main() must be public static void main(String[] args) — not private.

You cannot declare a private variable inside a method like this (private int batteryPercent;).

Also, a main() method doesn’t belong in an abstract class — you can’t instantiate it anyway.

✅ Fix:

Delete this entire main() block.
If you want to test the class, do it in a separate test class, like DoorLockTest.java.

❌ 2. batteryPercent is defined in the wrong place

You tried to define it inside the main() method.
It should be a field at the class level, outside of any methods.

✅ Fix:

Move it above your constructor:

public abstract class DoorLock extends Device implements Networked, BatteryPowered {
    private int batteryPercent;  // 👈 correct location

    public DoorLock(String id, String location, int initialBattery) {
        super(id, location);
        setBatteryPercent(initialBattery);
    }
    ...
}

❌ 3. Abstract class shouldn’t be instantiated

This one isn’t a compiler error, but a design one:
You can’t run main() in an abstract class because you can’t create a new DoorLock().
That’s by design — you’ll need a subclass like SmartDoorLock to implement/instantiate.

✅ 4. Other minor notes

Everything else looks fine:

Properly overrides Networked and BatteryPowered methods.

Throws IllegalArgumentException correctly for invalid battery levels.

Status string is clean and formatted well.

✅ Fixed Version

Here’s the corrected class:

package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4;

public abstract class DoorLock extends Device implements Networked, BatteryPowered {
    private int batteryPercent;

    public DoorLock(String id, String location, int initialBattery) {
        super(id, location);
        setBatteryPercent(initialBattery);
    }

    // Networked
    @Override 
    public void connect() { setConnected(true); }

    @Override 
    public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }

    @Override 
    public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

    // BatteryPowered
    @Override 
    public int getBatteryPercent() { return batteryPercent; }

    @Override 
    public void setBatteryPercent(int percent) {
        if (percent < 0 || percent > 100)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Battery percent must be between 0 and 100.");
        this.batteryPercent = percent;
    }

    // Status
    @Override 
    public String getStatus() {
        String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
        return "DoorLock[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
               ", conn=" + connStatus + ", batt=" + batteryPercent + "%]";
    }
}


✅ Summary of Fixes

Issue	Fix
Wrong main() declaration	Remove it entirely
private int batteryPercent inside method	Move to class field
Abstract class with main()	Move testing logic to another class
Minor readability	Keep consistent field + method placement

Prompt: What's wrong with the Thermostat class?
Response: Good question 👍 — there are several compile-time errors and design issues in this Thermostat class.
Let’s go step-by-step to fix it properly.

❌ Problems
1. Invalid method declarations
public double getTemperatureC();
public void setTemperatureC(double temperatureC);


These two lines end with semicolons but are not declared abstract, nor have method bodies.
In Java, you can only write a method like that if:

You mark it as abstract and

The enclosing class is abstract (which it is — so that’s allowed).

If you intend to implement the methods, they need curly braces {} and actual code.
If you intend to leave them abstract for subclasses to implement, add the abstract keyword.

2. Inconsistent intent

Right now, you already store and initialize temperatureC in the abstract class,
so it makes sense to implement the getters/setters here instead of leaving them abstract.

3. Minor style fix

Field assignment should use the setter for validation (e.g., check if the temp is within valid range).

✅ Fixed, Working Version

Here’s the correct implementation:

package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4;

public abstract class Thermostat extends Device implements Networked {
    private double temperatureC;

    public Thermostat(String id, String location, double initialTempC) {
        super(id, location);
        setTemperatureC(initialTempC);
    }

    // Temperature accessors
    public double getTemperatureC() {
        return temperatureC;
    }

    public void setTemperatureC(double temperatureC) {
        // Optional: add realistic validation
        if (temperatureC < -50 || temperatureC > 50) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Temperature must be between -50°C and 50°C.");
        }
        this.temperatureC = temperatureC;
    }

    // Networked
    @Override 
    public void connect() { setConnected(true); }

    @Override 
    public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }

    @Override 
    public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

    // Status
    @Override 
    public String getStatus() {
        String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
        return "Thermostat[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
               ", conn=" + connStatus + ", tempC=" + temperatureC + "]";
    }
}

🧠 If you meant to make those abstract:

You could instead write:

public abstract double getTemperatureC();
public abstract void setTemperatureC(double temperatureC);


…but then remove the field and constructor initialization, and let subclasses handle it —
which doesn’t make much sense here, since all thermostats should share those base behaviors.

✅ Summary of Fixes

Issue	Fix
Invalid method declarations	Implement or mark as abstract
Field temperatureC initialization	Use setter in constructor
Validation	Added optional range check for realism
Abstract class design	Now logically consistent and compilable
